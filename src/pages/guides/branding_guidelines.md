# Adobe Branding Guidelines

There are a [predefined set of guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/marketing/dev-brand-guide.html) that are published by Adobe periodically for the use of Adobe assets and product icons. It is expected that developers strictly adhere to these guidelines.

- Association with Adobe will increase acceptability within the user community and users are confident that plugins will meet Adobe's quality standards, which developers can leverage by using Adobe assets with their products.

- Adobe does not allow any change of product icons. Developers are allowed to use Adobe published assets and logos within their products, as long as they do not alter Adobe icons in any way.

- We expect you to thoroughly read the [Adobe Branding Guidelines](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/marketing/dev-brand-guide.html) with due diligence and follow the guidelines exactly. Failure to do so will result in rejection during the review process.

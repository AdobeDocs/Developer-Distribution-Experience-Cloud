## Answers

### How do I set up an account with FastSpring to collect revenue for my first paid listing?

Use [this link](https://fastspring.com/sign-up/payee-adobe/) to create an account with our third-party payment provider FastSpring in order to sell paid plugins.

Once you have your account you can [login to FastSpring](https://springboard.fastspring.com/email.xml) and set your payment method. After you obtain your key, set it in the Commerce section of your public profile under the "Account and Profile".

Please contact [CC Integrations Review](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/support/faq.html#Tabs_contentbody_section_par_tabs_tab3:~:text=CC%20Integrations%20Review) if you need help entering your FastSpring key.

### What do I do when I get “Access Denied” upon login?

First, if you have both an Enterprise and Personal account, you can try to login with the other. Next if you are in an Enterprirse, you should contact your Adobe Admin to get access. If you are not aware of who it is, see [this link](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/kb/contact-administrator.html). You can also consult the Admin Console Guide [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/users.ug.html). Adobe Employees can use the slack channel to get help [here](https://adobe-torq.slack.com/archives/C20KF6FAP). If you work for an Enterprise we recommend that you do not use your Personal account to develop any shared plugins.

### When will ZXPs be supported by this portal?

Support for ZXPs is planned for June 2023

### What is the revenue share for paid products?

For any paid product you offer for sale you will take 90% of the sales revenue. Further details are covered here. You will need to register with our payment provider FastSpring. After you have registered, you will receive a special FastSpring key and a small text reference you need to add to your profile page, so we can ensure all sales are applied to your account.

### What should I do to get support with development?

Please refer to this page for development support. The developer support annual case bundles are priced as follows:

- [Three cases for US$ 750](https://adobedeveloper-production.onfastspring.com/annual-developer-support-plan)
- [Seven cases for US$ 1,600](https://adobedeveloper-production.onfastspring.com/annual-developer-support-plan-7-cases)

### How do Tags work?

There are three types of Tags to choose when creating or editing a listing:

**Primary Tags** – These are for filtering Extensions on Adobe Exchange. Producers can choose up to two from a list of twenty primary tags. The “Most Popular Tags” filter on Adobe Exchange will display the twelve most popular tags. Producers can always go back and edit their primary tags if they are not displayed in the filter.

**Secondary Tags** – Producers can choose up to seven from the same 20 tags and these will be searchable on Adobe Exchange.

**Custom Tags** – Producers can enter up to two custom tags and these will also be searchable on Adobe Exchange. TIP: Use one-word custom tags. If two words are entered, the custom tag will be truncated to the first word.

**Migrated Tags from Add-ons Exchange Listings** - Migrated Tags will be grandfathered if they had more than the allowable 7+2 searchable tags. However, there is a max character count of 256 characters for secondary+custom tags. Delete some migrated tags to stay within the limit if new tags are desired.

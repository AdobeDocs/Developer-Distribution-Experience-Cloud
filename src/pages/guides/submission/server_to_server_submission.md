## Creating a Listing

A new listing can be created from the home page or the “Your listings” page. Clicking on ‘Create a new listing’ lands the developer on the modal overlay where they must choose the type of listing they want to create.

There are two types of ‘Server-to-server integration for Experience Cloud’ listings that developer can create on Developer Distribution. One is specific to an Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Sources streaming connector use case and the other use case is of a generic server-to-server integration for all other use cases such as for Adobe Analytics or Adobe Campaign. Note that:

* Sources connectors are also discoverable in AEP’s Sources catalog, and hence the developer needs to choose the AEP Sources specific listing card, called ‘AEP Sources streaming connectors’, if building a AEP Sources streaming connector
* For all other integrations, the developer needs to choose card ‘Server-to-server integration’

In order to create a server-to-server integration listing for Adobe’s Digital Experience products, the developer must have a sandbox Enterprise org associated with their Adobe login. All Technology Partner Program members get a sandbox enterprise org assigned upon approved registration. Attempting to create an integration listing without joining Technology Partner Program will result in the access denied screens as below:

Once the listing type has been chosen, another modal will ask the developer to choose the Developer Console project they want to be associated with the listing. Note that to create a server-to-server integration listing of either of the two types (AEP Sources connector or generic), The developer must choose an existing project that was created in Developer Console. Only the projects that have the required enterprise credential added to them will show up on this screen. If no project exists with an enterprise credential, the developer will need to first go to Developer Console and create it.

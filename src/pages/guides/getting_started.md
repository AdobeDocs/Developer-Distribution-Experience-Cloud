# Getting Started

This getting started guide introduces key areas of the [Adobe Developer Distribution portal](/distribute/home) to help you begin distributing your plugins quickly and easily. The Adobe Developer Distribution portal enables you to quickly publish a **listing** for your plugin on two Experience Cloud Marketplaces; the Experience Cloud desktop app Marketplace and Adobe Exchange in these three easy steps:

1. Add your public profile.
2. Create a **listing** to represent your plugin with metadata, the packaged plugin, and a **version**.
3. Submit your **listing** for approval to be published immediately or at a date you choose.

A **listing** is what users see on a Marketplace. It contains metadata to describe your plugin and how to use it, along with a specific **version** of your plugin to be installed by the Experience Cloud desktop app. For more details on these concepts and how they are used in the distribution of your plugin, see the [Glossary](./glossary.md).

## Overview

The following section will provide a brief overview of each view in the [Adobe Developer Distribution portal](/distribute/home) to help you get started using it quickly. This applies to both App Builder and service-to-service applications. 

## Home

The home page is where developers create their public profile and create a new listing for their plugin. Here you will find "Quick start" links to create a new listing and edit or view your public profile. The "Get Started" box helps reminds developers that a profile must be created and submitted before any plugin can be submitted for approval.

As listings are created, up to three of the most recent will be shown for quick view and access. As listings are published, an "Insights" summary table will replace the "Get Started" box. To manage more than three listings, choose the **All listings** link or the **Listings** tab in the nav bar to go to the "Your Listings" page.

## Submitting a Listing

Once you have built, tested, and packaged your app (using App Builder in the Adobe Developer Distribution portal), you can create a listing for the Marketplace. Executing the command "Distribute" will take you the Developer Console where you can create a listing for your app.

### Overview

**New Submission** - For your first submission, you must submit listing details and a new version together. After publishing, you can submit an update to the listing details or a new version independently from each other.

This is the landing page where you will create your submission. Before you get started, do the following: 

1. Look at the navigation panel on the left to confirm you are on the Listing Details screen.
2. In the upper right-hand corner, make sure your role and your organization's name are listed. If you need to edit any of your profile details, click the "Edit Public Profile" tab.
3. The menu at the top of the screen indicates your listing status, the platform you are using, the last modified date, and your APP ID. You are now ready to add the listing details for your app. 

### Listing Details

You will submit your app builder new listing metadata in four tabs: General, Media, Categories, and Payment. All mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk. “Add a version” helper text reminds you that a version is also needed the first time a listing is published. Instructions on adding a version are provided later in this document.

When you've finished adding all the listing details, click the blue button labeled Save Draft & Add Version. 

CHANTA: ADD SCREENSHOT OF APPBUILDER Save_Draft HERE.

You will see a confirmation indicating that your draft has been created.

Next, you will upload your application package. Make sure to follow the instructions and size requirements.

### Version Details

NOTE from CHANTA: I'm not sure when the developer is supposed to add a version. Is it before they click Review & Submit in the next step? 

Once you have uploaded your app package, click the Review & Submit button. 

CHANTA: ADD SCREENSHOT OF APPBUILDER Review and Submit HERE. 

Now, you can submit your application for review. 

CHANTA: ADD SCREENSHOT OF APPBUILDER Submit Application HERE.

You will see a confirmation that your app has been successfully submitted.

### Manage Screen 

Once your app has been submitted, it must be approved by an Adobe administrator. To check the status of your submission, go to the Manage tab and look to see if there is an approval message near the bottom of the screen. Then follow the instructions to add a new environment to start installing your application.

Once you have created your new environment, click the blue Deploy tab.

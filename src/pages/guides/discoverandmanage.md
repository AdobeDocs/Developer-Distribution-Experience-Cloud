# Discover, acquire & manage App Builder apps and software integrations

Customers can discover and manage their entitlements once acquired on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec).

Adobe Exchange detail pages will instruct enterprise customers on how to acquire software integrations directly from the developer. App Builder Apps can be acquired directly from the Adobe Exchange detail pages by enterprise users. From the **Manage** page, enterprise admins can Review/Approve or Revoke, install environment(s), choose product profiles & custom configurations, before deploying the App Builder app to the user.

<br/>

## Discover

Published software integrations and App Builder apps will appear on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec). Apps can be discovered using keyword search, filter and sort. Users can also filter apps by partnership level developer. Below is an example of using App Builder as a search key word.

## Acquire

If, after viewing the application details, the user decides to acquire the app, they can click the ‘Free’ button on the top right. A modal will appear to confirm that the user’s organization has the required Adobe products.

If the user clicks on the ‘Accept and continue’ button on the End-user license agreement, they will be taken to the sign-up-sign-in screen and required to login to the Exchange marketplace (if they aren’t already logged in). Once they log in, the app will be acquired for the org associated with their login credentials. The ‘Free’ button will be replaced by ‘Manage’, and the app will start showing as ‘Acquired’. Users will also see a confirmation modal informing them that the app has been acquired, and their system administrator must approve the acquisition before it can be deployed and used.

## Manage

Clicking ‘Manage’ on the app listing details page, or the ‘Manage your app’ button in the ‘Application acquired’ modal will open the Experience Cloud Applications tab on the ‘Manage’ page with a list of all acquired applications.

The user can also navigate to the Manage tab from the global navigation bar on the Exchange marketplace and click on the ‘Experience Cloud Applications’ tab to view a list of all acquired apps for their org. Admins logged into Adobe Exchange will additionally have the option to ‘Review’(approve) or ‘Revoke’ App Builder apps that have been acquired.

Clicking on any app’s name on the Experience Cloud Applications tab will open the application details page for that app, where the user will have the option to ‘Get support’ from the developer, ‘View documentation’ for the app, and ‘View listing’ on the Exchange marketplace.

Clicking on the card of an environment will route the administrator to the details page for that environment. On the ‘Configuration’ tab, they will see the option to choose the custom configurations and product profiles for the environment before deploying the application. These custom configurations are provided by the app developer with the upload of the application’s package. Custom Configurations will vary from application to application, depending on the configurations needed for optimal functionality. See ["App Builder Public Distribution"](/app-builder/docs/guides/distribution/public) for more info on how to define user configuration options.

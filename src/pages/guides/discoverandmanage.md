# Discover, acquire & manage App Builder apps and Software integrations

Customers can discover and manage their entitlements once acquired on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec).

Adobe Exchange detail pages will instruct enterprise customers on how to acquire software integrations directly from the developer. App Builder Apps can be acquired directly from the Adobe Exchange detail pages by enterprise users. From the **Manage** page, enterprise admins can Review/Approve or Revoke, install environment(s), choose product profiles & custom configurations, before deploying the App Builder app to the user.

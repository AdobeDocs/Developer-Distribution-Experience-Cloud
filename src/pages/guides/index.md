# Adobe Developer Distribution

A self-service submission portal for developers to publish listings that extend Adobe Experience Cloud products on the Experience Cloud Marketplace.​

## Overview

Use Developer Distribution to publish and distribute App Builder Apps, Service-to-service integrations and Catalog listings to extend Adobe Experience Cloud products. Once submitted, these listings will be approved by Adobe reviewers before being published on Adobe Exchange.

## Three types of Experience Cloud listings

1.  App Builder listings: Adobe Developer App Builder applications that run on Adobe runtime and are published on the Adobe Exchange and Adobe Commerce marketplaces.
2.  Server-to-server listings: Server-to-server multi-tenant integrations that customers can acquire and manage on the Adobe Exchange marketplace.
3.  Catalog listings: Rich metadata-only, server-to-server (software) integrations for all Experience Cloud products that customers can browse but must be acquired directly from the publisher.

## Access the Developer Distribution Portal

Developers must join the [Technology Partner Portal (TPP)](https://partners.adobe.com/technologyprogram/experiencecloud.html) in order to publish Experience Cloud listings. After joining, developers can request product sandboxes and are assigned an org/account to manage listings. The first TPP registered user for an enterprise developer can enable other users to access Developer Distribution and Developer Console by assigning an admin role for additional Adobe ID user credentials in [Admin Console Login](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). This way, anyone assocated with their org/account will be able to manage projects and listings. TPP members who still get an error attempting to use Developer Distribution should contact [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/case).

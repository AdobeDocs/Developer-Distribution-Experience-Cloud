# Adobe Developer Distribution

A self-service submission portal for developers to publish listings that extend Adobe Experience Cloud products on the Experience Cloud Marketplace.​

## Overview

Use [Developer Distribution Overview](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/) to publish and distribute App Builder Apps, Service-to-service integrations and Catalog listings for to extend Adobe Experience Cloud products. Once submitted, these listings are approved by Adobe reviewers before being published on Adobe Exchange.

## Three types of Experience Cloud listings

1.  App Builder listings: Adobe Developer App Builder applications that run on Adobe runtime and are published on the Adobe Exchange and Adobe Commerce marketplaces.
2.  Server-to-server listings: Server-to-server multi-tenant integrations that customers can acquire and manage on the Adobe Exchange marketplace.
3.  Catalog listings: Rich metadata-only, server-to-server (software) integrations for all Experience Cloud products that customers can browse but must be acquired directly from the publisher.

## Access the Developer Distribution Portal

Developers must join the [Technology Partner Portal (TPP)](https://partners.adobe.com/technologyprogram/experiencecloud.html)in order to publish Experience Cloud listings. After joining, developers can request product sandboxes and are assigned an org/account to manage listings. The first TPP registered user can enable other users to access [Developer Distribution login](https://developer.adobe.com/distribute ) and [Developer Console login](https://developer.adobe.com/console/) by assigning an admin role for additional Adobe ID user credentials in [Admin Console Login](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). TPP members who still get an error attempting to use Developer Distribution should contact [TPP Support](https://partners.adobe.com/ec/cform/case).

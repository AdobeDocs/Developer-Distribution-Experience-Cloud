# Overview

Adobe Developer Distribution (DD) is a purpose-built portal for distributing 3rd party Creative Cloud UXP plugins. Previously, developers associated projects, created a plugin ID and distributed UXP plugins from Developer Console. Now if developers choose to “Distribute” from Console they will land on the home page of DD. This documentation provides guidance on how to use DD and all the new developer features it unlocks. Future releases of DD will support ZXP plugins, UXP plugins for more CC Apps and 3rd party integration for other Clouds.

Developer Distribution enables you to quickly publish a Listing on two CC Marketplaces: Creative Cloud Desktop plugin marketplace and Adobe Exchange in four steps:

1. Create and submit a public profile
2. Create and submit Listing metadata
3. Upload a packaged plugin version (includes a manifest)
4. Submit and listing publishes immediately upon approval or manually published later.

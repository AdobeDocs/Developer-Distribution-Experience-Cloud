## Answers

### What is Developer Distribution?
Developer Distribution is a unified portal where you will be able to submit your CEP and UXP plugin listings, and manage them. Read [this announcement blog post](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/introducing-a-new-developer-distribution-portal-for-listing-uxp-plugins-in-the-creative-cloud-7f81376f46a9) to learn more. Also, check out the [frequently asked questions](../faq.md) about Developer Distribution.

### Why can't I see my CEP Listings?
If you had multiple users that could access your ZXP plugins in the Creative Cloud Adobe Exchange Portal, someone from your team might have logged into Developer Distribution first.  The first person from a multi-user account that logs into Developer Distribution is assigned as the administrator of a developer org with all of your ZXP plugins assigned to it. Ask that person to log into Adobe Admin Console to assign your Adobe ID in the same org and your access will be restored. Now ZXP and UXP developers can use a single org (with multiple users) to manage all their plugins and they will appear together under one publisher profile on Adobe Exchange. ​

# Adobe Digital Experience Partner Program guide

These brand guidelines have been created to give you an overview of the program, specifics about using your partner badge, as well as other Adobe assets available to you. All of these elements are meant to be used within your own unique branded look and feel—one that distinguishes them from the Adobe look and feel.

You will need to be logged into the Partner Experience Hub with your partner credentials to view the [Adobe Digital Experience Partner Program brand guide](https://partners.adobe.com/digitalexperience/preview/restricted/1/brand-guide.pdf.html). Please review the guide carefully and follow the guidelines exactly. Failure to do so will result in rejection during the review process.

# Get a Plugin ID

Each Marketplace listing should have a unique Plugin ID. The plugin package manifest should use the same ID that is associated with the listing. You can obtain a unique plugin ID in any of the following three ways:

## Starting from the Adobe UXP Developer Tool (UDT)

Create a plugin in UDT and click "Distribute". From the [Developer Distribution home page](/distribute/home), create a new listing and simply copy the unique plugin ID generated, then insert that plugin ID into your plugin package manifest file.

## Starting from Adobe Developer Distribution

Create a new listing from the [Developer Distribution home page](/distribute/home) and download a starter package from the "Listing Overview" page, which will automatically contain the new plugin ID. Add the plugin executable to the starter package and upload plugin.

## Starting from Adobe Developer Console

Add a plugin to a project in Developer Console, download a starter package. Click on "Distribute" and you will be redirected to the Developer Distribution "Listing Overview" page.

This is considered a legacy option with the introduction of the new Developer Distribution portal.

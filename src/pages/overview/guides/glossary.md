# Glossary

## App
A 3rd-party distributable item. It could be a UXP/ZXP plugin, a DX Application, an Adobe Sign Integration etc. and may or may not be associated with an API. To unlock future features, all Apps will have a project assigned to them.

## Listing 
How an App is published on the marketplace. A Listing contains metadata and at least one plugin Version.

## Version
The downloadable portion of an App. A UXP listing can have multiple versions available to users simultaneously while ZXP listings only offer the latest version.

## Listing Status
The lifecycle of a listing can be tracked by status on the “Your Listings” and Listings details pages. The lifecycle of multiple versions within a listing (i.e., Version Status) is displayed on the left rail of the Listing details page.

- **Draft** – A listing that does not have complete metadata or has not been reviewed.

- **In Review** – A listing that has been submitted but is waiting for reviewer approval

- **Approved** – A listing that has been reviewed but not yet published. A developer has chosen to “publish later” and can do so by clicking the “Publish” CTA.

- **Published** – A reviewed listing that can be searched and browsed on a marketplace if public. DP deep-link is enabled to allow users to acquire public or limited apps.

- **Retracted** – A reviewed published listing whose Detail Page deep-link is disabled and no longer discoverable.

- **Rejected** – A submission that was rejected by reviewers. Reviewer notes are displayed on the listing page until the first edit is saved whereby the status goes back to Draft.

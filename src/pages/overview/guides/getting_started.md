# Getting Started

To begin creating Listings quickly and easily, this overview document introduces key areas of the Adobe Developer Distribution user interface (UI). A _Listing_ is what users see on a marketplace. It contains metadata to describe the plugin and how to use it plus a _Version_ of a plugin that gets installed by Creative Cloud Desktop.

## Steps

Developer Distribution enables you to quickly publish a Listing on two Creative Cloud Marketplaces; Creative Cloud Desktop marketplace and Adobe Exchange in four steps:

1. Create and submit a public profile
2. Create and submit Listing metadata
3. Upload a packaged plugin version (includes a manifest)
4. Submit and listing publishes immediately upon approval or manually published later.

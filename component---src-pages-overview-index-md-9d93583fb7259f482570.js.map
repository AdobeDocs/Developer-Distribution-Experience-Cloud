Previously, developers associated projects, created a plugin ID and distributed UXP plugins from Developer Console. Now if developers choose to “Distribute” from Console they will land on the home page of DD. This documentation provides guidance on how to use DD and all the new developer features it unlocks. Future releases of DD will support ZXP plugins, UXP plugins for more CC Apps and 3rd party integration for other Clouds.\n     Developer Distribution enables you to quickly publish a Listing on two CC Marketplaces: Creative Cloud desktop app plugin Marketplace and Adobe Exchange in four steps:\n     1. Create and submit a public profile\n     2. Create and submit Listing metadata\n     3. Upload a packaged plugin version (includes a manifest)\n     4. Submit and listing publishes immediately upon approval or manually published later.\n     ## Access\n     For individual users who do not belong to an Adobe enterprise or team organization, we will automatically create your own personal Developer organization during sign-up. This is the most common scenario for UXP Plugin Developers. Note that if multiple people need to manage a plugin, they will have to share the same Adobe ID credential used.\n     Users who already belong to an Adobe enterprise or team organization require either System Administrator or Developer permissions to access the Adobe Developer Console. If you are denied access to Developer Distribution when logging in with a “Company” adobe ID, contact your system administrator about assigning you Developer permissions. More information about user management can be found in the Adobe Admin Console guide. */}\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["name","_frontmatter","Hero","props","console","warn","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","mdxType","slots","background","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
